        "Q1. What is the difference between '_ __ getattr _ _ 'and ' _ _ getattribute _ _?\n",
        "Ans: _ _ getattribute _ _ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. _ _ getattr _ _ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by _ _ getattribute _ _ , but for this _ _ getattribute _ _ and _ _ getattr _ _ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, _ _ getattr _ _ returns a default value.\n",
