        "Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial ?\n",
        "Ans: Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. It is used in case when we have to import multiple functions from same module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What are some of a module's characteristics? (Name at least one.)\n",
        "Ans: The following are some of a module's characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "_ _ name _ _ : It returns the name of the module\n",
        "_ _ doc _ _ : It denotes the documentation string line written in a module code.\n",
        "_ _ file _ _ : It holds the name and path of the module file from which it is loaded\n",
        "_ _ dict _ _ : It return a dictionary object of module attributes, functions and other definitions and their respective values\n",
        "Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
        "Ans: One way to avoid mutual importing is to use a design pattern known as the \"Circle-Ellipse\" pattern, in which a module in the circular dependency chain is refactored to import only the specific items it needs from the other module, rather than importing the entire module. This breaks the circular dependency and allows the modules to be imported in a specific order. Another method is to use a 'Facade' pattern, where a single module acts as an interface to the functionality provided by the mutually importing modules, thus avoiding the circular import.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another approach would be to use an import statement inside a function, so that the import occurs only when the function is called, rather than when the module is imported. This way, the module that is being imported won't be in memory until the function is called and the import statement is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Why is _ _ all _ _ in Python ?\n",
        "Ans: It provides list of all modules present in a library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the _ _ name _ _ attribute or the string _ _ main _ _ ?\n",
        "Ans: During the time of execution of the code if we want to refer the module in which we are working on then we uses name attribute. In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string _ _ _main _ _ _.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What are some of the benefits of attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line?\n",
        "Ans: A program counter (PC) can be useful in an RPN interpreter application as it allows the interpreter to keep track of the current line or instruction being executed, and to move to the next instruction or line of code as appropriate. This can make it easier to debug and troubleshoot the interpreter, as well as to add features such as breakpoints and stepping through the code. Additionally, a PC can also be used to implement features such as subroutines, loops and jump statements, allowing for more complex scripts to be executed with the RPN interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What are the minimum expressions or statements (or both) that you'd need to render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but completeâ€” that is, capable of carrying out any computerised task theoretically possible?\n",
        "Ans: A basic RPN interpreter would need at least the following expressions or statements to be considered primitive but complete:\n",
        "\n",
        "Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
        "Comparison operations such as equals, less than, greater than, etc.\n",
        "Logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT.\n",
        "Basic input/output operations such as reading input from the user and displaying output to the screen.\n",
        "Stack manipulation operations such as push, pop, dup, swap, etc.\n",
        "Control flow statements such as if-else, while loops, and subroutine calls.\n",
        "Memory management operations such as allocating and deallocating memory.\n",
        "Data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.\n",
        "With these basic building blocks, the RPN interpreter can perform any computationally expressible task theoretically possible. However, for more advanced features such as file handling, networking, and GUI, additional libraries or modules would have to be used."
